## Configuration of use

1. Adding the app as a theme dependency in the `manifest.json` file:
`"acctglobal.rattings-reviews": "0.x"`
2. Declaring the app's main block in your store-theme template or inside another block from the theme.

```
{
  "store.home": {
    "blocks": ["rattings-reviews"]
  } 
}
```


## Modus Operandi *(not mandatory)*

It is necessary to link this app to a Master Data whose form has the same fields. In this case, the API call is made with fetch in a REST endpoint Documents, like this:
```
 fetch('/api/dataentities/YA/documents', requestOptions)
 ...
 ```
*YA* means *your acronym*. This endpoint to is an entity in Master Data v1, where the entities is named with an acronym of 2 captalize letters. If your data entity is created in Master Data v2, the acronym must be changed for the name of the entity


## Customization

For customization of fields and the button, about colors and shapes was used [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/). The *font-family* is inherited from the theme

`No CSS Handles are available yet for the app customization.`
